## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities privately so we can address them responsibly:

1. Email the maintainers at [security@meerai.dev](mailto:security@meerai.dev) with the details.
2. Include reproduction steps, affected versions, and any relevant logs or proof-of-concept exploits.
3. Allow us reasonable time to investigate and prepare a fix before any public disclosure.

We will:

- Acknowledge receipt within **3 business days**.
- Provide status updates as we triage and remediate the issue.
- Credit you (if desired) once a fix is published and users are informed.

Thank you for helping keep Meer AI and its users secure.
