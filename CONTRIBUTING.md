## Contributing Guidelines

### Types of Contributions

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

- **Bug Fixes**: Fix existing issues
- **Feature Additions**: Add new functionality
- **Documentation**: Improve docs and comments
- **Testing**: Add or improve tests
- **Performance**: Optimize existing code
- **UI/UX**: Improve user experience

### Before You Start

1. Check existing issues and pull requests
2. Discuss major changes in an issue first
3. Ensure your changes align with the project goals
4. Follow the existing code style and patterns

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

- `feature/add-image-analysis`
- `fix/path-parsing-issue`
- `docs/update-contributing`
- `refactor/improve-workflow`

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Examples:

- `feat(agent): add image analysis capability`
- `fix(cli): handle escaped spaces in file paths`
- `docs: update contributing guidelines`

### Development Process

1. Create a new branch from `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes

3. Test your changes:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm test
   ```

4. Commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature"
   ```

5. Push to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. Create a pull request

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Structure

- Unit tests: `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/`
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/`

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests still pass
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use descriptive test names

## Code Style

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Code Formatting

We use Prettier for code formatting:

```bash
# Format code
npm run format

# Check formatting
npm run format:check
```

### Linting

We use ESLint for code linting:

```bash
# Run linter
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix
```

### File Organization

- One main export per file
- Group related functionality
- Use barrel exports for clean imports
- Keep files focused and small

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Run linting and formatting
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Add tests for new features
5. Update CHANGELOG.md if applicable

### PR Template
